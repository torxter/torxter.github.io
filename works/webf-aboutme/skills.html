                        <td>5+ years</td>
                        <td>I learned to code by using Expage and Geocities way back in the 'day. 
                            I eventually self taught myself HTML with a friend - we eventually joined 
                            a web ring of other HTML coders. Like all amateur site builders, we both 
                            went on hiatus because we thought it was cool - but it actually meant we 
                            got bored.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>CSS</td>
                        <td>5+ years</td>
                        <td>After learning HTML, I learned CSS. I learned how to make my sites look 
                            pretty. There's still a pocket CSS book lying around at my parents' house
                            that taught me a lot of methods as I was (and still am) bad at Googling
                            stuff.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>JavaScript</td>
                        <td>3 months</td>
                        <td>Javascript is new to me - however, it's not too much of a challenge to learn.
                            I have experience in other scripting languages such as Python, so making the 
                            transition to Javascript was not too difficult.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Python</td>
                        <td>2+ years</td>
                        <td>Python was the first language I learned in university. I learned when I went to
                            U of T for a year. I learned the basics of Python, and I've been using it ever since.
                            It's a great language for teaching, and I've used it for a variety of projects. I think
                            it's one of the best programming languages because of its readability and flexibility.
