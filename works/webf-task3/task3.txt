                <h2>A Short Summary</h2>
                <p>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is based off of a novel by Rohald Dahl. It is loved by many generations for its vivid colours, creative set design, and a magnificent performance by Gene Wilder. People also tend to enjoy that bratty kids get what's coming to them.</p>

            <section id="synopsis">
                <h2>Synopsis... from memory... Mr. Dahl forgive me.</h2>
                <p>Charlie Bucket is a child living in poverty with his mother and four elders (one being his grandpa, others being aunties and an uncle, maybe). In his idyllic but poor European home town is the functioning, yet inspectorless, Wonka Chocolate Factory which had re-opened years prior after a period of corporate espionage that leaked the factory owner's IP. Ingredients go in, trucks come out, the state is weak, and sugar cravings are rampant.</p>
                <p>The plot of the movie swings into full motion after a proclamation by the Wonka company of a factory tour to be given to five children by the company owner, Mr. Willy Wonka himself. The contest format? Finding a golden ticket in a classic Wonka Bar.</p>
                <p>After a large media frenzy, four of the five children are found, all representing at least one of the seven deadly sins in their personality and demeanor. Charlie tries to participate twice - however on his first attempt royally screws up and buys the incorrect candy bar that had an absolute 0% chance of finding the ticket. He succeeds on his second attempt.</p>
                <p>On his way home, he is pulled aside by a stranger in the dark. The stranger offers him piles of money to steal products and/or secrets from the Wonka Candy Company while he is touring the factory. Charlie runs back home afterward.</p>
                <p>Initially wanting to take his mother on the tour, she declines as she has to work or something. His grandpa then gets out of bed for the first time in years, clearly motivated by the sugar and forgetting his fake ailments.</p>
                <p>The rest of the movie continues as follows:</p>

                <p class="no-big">10/10 it's a classic. I also like the Tim Burton one. Both have their place.</p>
