                <p><i>Heroes of the Storm</i> has a variety of maps that change the game meta depending on the map's objectives. 
                <p>Some maps are more popular than others, and some are even retired from the game.</p>

                <p>Style: 3 lane, collection objective</p>
                <p>Objective: players must collect and submit gems from siege minions and opponent takedowns to summon the spider queen's daughters which push each lane.</p>
                <p>My thoughts: I enjoy this map quite a bit because it's on the smaller size, which enables more lane roaming to cover for teammates with low map awareness.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: I find Dragon Shire a little bit too hectic for random team matches - often lanes get abandoned and stratigic opponents often have a disproportionate influence on the match.</p>

                <p>Objective: players must capture and defend temples to deal damage to the enemy core.</p>
                <p>My thoughts: This map is tough if you don't move quickly and have a strong solo teammate with map awareness. One opponent can smartly roam to camps to overwhelm your team, making for a sloppy defeat.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: I enjoy this map because it often has some good team fights - the objective is important enough to draw in most people from the lanes to focus on the objective. Camps aren't too overpowered but do have an important strategic influence on the match outcome.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: I like having the variety of a 2 lane map thrown into the mix. Smart strategists know when to focus on lanes, camps, or when to head mid for the epic team fights. Chases are common in this map with significant outcomes that influence the match.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: I like this map as it's not too large. The conveyors make for hectic fights and strong camp heroes have a strong influence on the match.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: Good for map variety - I find this map has too strong of a timing meta however, which is something I generally do not enjoy in MOBAs. Boss and off-lane strategy make and break this map.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: I've enjoyed this map ever since it was reworked - there's so much going on that map strategy is incredibly important. There are also enough portals that the size of the map is compensated for - backdoors are harder to accomplish.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: I enjoyed this map more prior to its rework - there was high risk and high reward to sneaking out from lanes and capturing seeds on your own. Due to the layout of the map, team fights are crowded and disadvantage many heroes to the point that I really only enjoy playing this map in draft.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: Blackheart's Bay used to be one of my favourites - now I find it too calcified in the meta. It requires very specific strategies to master, and if your teammates do not know them, you're bound to lose.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: This one contradicts earlier statements - it requires strict gameplay meta adherance, but still contains enough nuance (and a small map size) to allow you to wiggle your way to victory.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: This map is one of my favourites because it changes the whole gameplay meta up completely: you can't directly attack the enemy's core. While highly dependent on team skill, smart strategic gameplay can sneak in a victory.</p>

                </p>
                <p>My thoughts: This is the weakest ARAM map due to it being veritically aligned, having no bushes, and the conveyors. While fun on certain heroes, top spawn is at a significant disadvantage.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: A standard ARAM map; camps are strategically inaccessible which reduces meta-forced timing.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: The lack of camps is kind of a bummer, but forces variety and reduces the chance of snowballs.</p>

                <p>My thoughts: This map has a lot of timing meta forced due to its layout, which can lead to dull gameplay.</p>

                <p>Style: 2 lane, collection objective</p>
                <p>Objective: players must defeat time-spawned minions and a boss to collect skulls, which power up a golem boss in each lane.</p>
                <p>My thoughts: This map was a lot of fun, I never managed to figure out the meta before it was retired. Pure chaos. Subterranian crossover? Amazing.</p>
