                <h2>About the Game</h2>
                <p>Heroes of the Storm is a 2015 MOBA made by Blizzard. It brings in IP from its various franchises into one big 5v5 arena that focuses on 
                    individual character talents and team play. The game is free to play, but has a lot of microtransactions.</p>
